# Markdown Features

Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

## Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```text title="my-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
// highlight-end

## Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](/create-a-page).
```

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).
```

**Result:** Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported.

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/docusaurus.png`):

```md
![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)
```

![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)

You can reference images relative to the current file as well. This is particularly useful to colocate images close to the Markdown files using them:

```md
![Docusaurus logo](./img/docusaurus.png)
```

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting.

    ```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
    function HelloDocusaurus() {
        return (
            <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>
        )
    }
    ```

```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>;
}
```

## Admonitions

Docusaurus has a special syntax to create admonitions and callouts:

    :::tip My tip

    Use this awesome feature option

    :::

    :::danger Take care

    This action is dangerous

    :::

:::tip My tip

:::

:::danger Take care

This action is dangerous

## MDX and React Components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) can make your documentation more **interactive** and allows using any **React components inside Markdown**:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`);
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !

<details>

<summary>Expandable items</summary>

After pushing to main, if you don't see your site published at the desired location (for example, it says "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here", or it's showing your repo's README.md file), check the following:

- It may take a few minutes for GitHub pages to pick up the new files, so wait for about 3 minutes and refresh before concluding it isn't working.
- On your repo's landing page, you should see a little green tick next to the last commit's title, indicating the CI has passed. If you see a cross, it means the build or deployment failed, and you should check the log for more debugging information.
- Click on the tick and make sure your see a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow. Names like "pages build and deployment / deploy" are GitHub's default workflows, indicating your custom deployment workflow failed to be triggered at all. Make sure the YAML files are put under the `.github/workflows` folder, and the trigger condition is set correctly (for example, if your default branch is "master" instead of "main", you need to change the `on.push` property).
- We are using `gh-pages` as the deployment branch. Under your repo's Settings > Pages, make sure the "Source" (which is the source for the _deployment_ files, not "source" as in our terminology) is set to "gh-pages" + "/ (root)".
- If you are using a custom domain, make sure the DNS record is pointing to the GitHub pages servers' IP.
